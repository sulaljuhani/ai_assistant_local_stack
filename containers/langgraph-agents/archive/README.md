# LangGraph Implementation Archive

This folder contains implementation summaries, integration plans, and refactoring documentation created during the development of the LangGraph multi-agent system.

## Contents

### Tool Integration Documentation
- **TOOL_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of 21 new task tools integration (Nov 20, 2025)
- **NEW_TOOLS_FROM_ATLAS.md** - Analysis of Atlas MCP server features and implementation
- **EVENT_TOOLS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - Complete guide for implementing 18 event tools
- **EVENT_TOOLS_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of event tools integration
- **PROPOSED_EVENT_TOOLS.md** - Proposed event tools based on task tool expansion

### System Refactoring
- **REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md** - Agent system refactoring to LangGraph best practices (Nov 20, 2025)

## Context

These documents capture the evolution of the LangGraph multi-agent system from initial implementation through major feature additions and refactoring efforts. They represent completed work and are preserved for historical reference.

### Key Milestones

1. **Initial Multi-Agent Implementation** - Built Food, Task, Event, and Reminder agents
2. **Task Tools Expansion** - Added 21 new tools inspired by Atlas MCP server
3. **Event Tools Expansion** - Added 18 new event management tools
4. **System Refactoring** - Aligned with LangGraph tutorial best practices

## Current Documentation

For current, active documentation about the LangGraph system:
- [LangGraph Architecture](../ARCHITECTURE.md) - Current technical implementation
- [Prompt Guide](../PROMPT_GUIDE.md) - How to modify agent prompts
- [LangGraph Flow Diagram](../../../docs/LANGGRAPH_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md) - Visual architecture
- [README.md](../README.md) - Main LangGraph system documentation

## Why Archived?

These documents served as implementation guides and summaries during development. Now that the work is complete:
- Features are documented in the main codebase
- Architecture is described in ARCHITECTURE.md
- Tools are self-documented via docstrings
- These summaries provide historical context for understanding the development process
