# Archived Documentation

This folder contains historical and completed implementation documentation that is no longer actively maintained but preserved for reference.

## Contents

### Phase Implementation Documentation
- **PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Initial implementation phase
- **PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Second development phase
- **PHASE_3_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Third development phase
- **PHASE_4_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Fourth development phase

### Gap Analysis & Architecture
- **ARCHITECTURE_GAPS_ANALYSIS.md** - Architecture gap analysis (completed)
- **GAPS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Quick reference for gaps (resolved)

### Feature Documentation
- **FOOD_LOG_FEATURE.md** - Food logging feature documentation
- **FOOD_TRACKER_UPDATES.md** - Food tracker update history

### Legacy Implementations
- **PYDANTIC_AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md** - Pydantic AI implementation guide (superseded by LangGraph)
- **PYDANTIC_AI_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Pydantic AI implementation details (superseded by LangGraph)

### Migration & Security
- **N8N_WORKFLOW_SECURITY_FIX_GUIDE.md** - n8n security fixes (n8n deprecated)

### Planning Documents
- **CUSTOM_WEBUI_PLAN.md** - Custom WebUI implementation plan (archived, OpenWebUI in use)
- **PRE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** - Pre-deployment checklist (superseded by Production Readiness Report)

## Why Archived?

These documents were moved to the archive for the following reasons:

1. **Completed Work**: Phase implementations and gap analyses represent completed work
2. **Superseded Technology**: Pydantic AI was replaced with LangGraph multi-agent system
3. **Deprecated Features**: n8n workflows migrated to native Python FastAPI
4. **Historical Reference**: Preserved for understanding project evolution
